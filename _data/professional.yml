  location: Santa Clara, CA
  when: Dec 2012 - Present
  summary: Currently working in the graphics compiler team to develop a unified shader compiler for graphics and GPGPU api’s across all desktop and mobile operating systems.
  bullets: 
    - Was a key member of the new graphics compiler frontend and midend. Involved since the inception to the delivery of the project from end to end.
    - Architected and implemented the Apple Metal Frontend and worked closely with Apple engineers to make it functional.
    - Implemented new frameworks for reading metadata coming from different api’s.
    - Designed and implemented the DirectX 10, 11 frontend including the parser and code generator, making it modular to be extendible for future api’s using design patterns.
    - Added infrastructure to be able to detect memory leaks.
    - Designed and Implemented the Geometry Shader and Compute Shader units of the compiler.
    - Prototyped memory allocators for benchmarking compile time performance improvements.
    - Implemented various optimizations for the compiler to improve performance leading to multiple patents.
    - Debugged various games, WHQL, Metal unit tests, OCL Khronos tests for both performance and functional issues.
    - Managed the team for a period of 3 months when manager was on sabbatical.
    - Mentored multiple interns and managed contractors.
    - Was responsible for creating and productizing multiple tools including a first of its kind shader debugger (C#, WPF), a dashboard for measuring statistics and performance data (Django) and tools for managing machine pools (C#).

  when: Oct 2007 - Dec 2010
  summary: Worked in a R&D environment to design and develop products as well as enhance and rearchitect the core engine to improve performance and functionality. 
  bullets:
    - Re-architected the graphics pipeline for the emodel© engine to achieve a significant performance improvement for heavy meshes to improve rendering and user interaction using C / C++ and OpenGL.
    - Implemented Core Engine enhancements in the Geometry based algorithms using C / C++. 
    - Did UI design based on Qt and C++ for the engine.
    - Worked on embedding Python and Tcl into the core engine to enable embedded scripting.
    - Worked on geometric algorithms for enhancing the crown building algorithms for auto-building of various parts of a tooth.
    - Was involved in development of a metric database system using Django for the production tracking of the ICON™ digital assembly line.
    - Conceptualized, developed and prototyped the Metal Occlusal product for the ICON™ dental production system and eventually got it to production.
    - Designed and architected the emodel 9.0 software for Orthodontists. 
    - Designed and implemented the AutoGrid application using C# which integrates the ICON system with the Rapid Prototyping system.
